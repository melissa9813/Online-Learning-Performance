# Online-Learning-Performance

Massive open online courses (MOOC) (http://moocdata.cn/data/MOOCCube) have been on the rise amid the recent pandemic. The majority of
students' education has delivered online as a result of social distancing which has been implemented
for the last three years around the world to overcome COVID-19. In other words, COVID-19 has further
enhanced the need to improve the quality of online classes. Despite the increased need for better online
courses, the lack of research on students’ online learning behaviors has perplexed high education
institutions. This situation has provoked active research on applying artificial intelligence such as
natural language processing, image recognition, or speech recognition to online education.

One of the most effective ways to strengthen student performance is to reform the evaluation technique
according to experts in pedagogy. This project will make use of MOOCCube, a large-scale open data
repository for massive online courses, to develop a student performance prediction model using four
features of student online behavior: average number of video views, average video completion rate,
number of registered courses, and average course enroll time. In order to compare the performance of
the fuzzy inference system and multiple regression, the same predictive model was developed in two
different ways.

This project aims to reduce uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of online classes by predicting
academic performance from the learning behaviors of students. There are three objectives:

- To apply a K-means clustering to classify students’ online learning behavior.
- To construct developing a fuzzy inference system in order to predict a student’s academic
performance based on rules regarding learning behaviors.
- To compare the effectiveness of fuzzy logic and multiple regression in predicting students’
academic performance.
